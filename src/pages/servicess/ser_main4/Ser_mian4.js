                <p>Tooth loss is extremely prevalent in the United States. 20% of Americans over the age of 65 are missing all of their teeth. Luckily, significant medical advances have been made providing a multitude of dental treatment options to reestablish your self-esteem and ability to eat, speak, and smile confidently. Implant-supported dentures, sometimes called all-on-four, hybrid dentures, implant dentures, or teeth-in-a-day, are dental prosthetics that replace all of your upper teeth and/or lower teeth. These are more secure than traditional dentures and the dental implants act as artificial tooth roots, stimulating your jaw and helping to prevent bone loss.</p>
